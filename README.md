I have made this project on pycharm if you dont hava it you can also run this project smoothly on VScode. After importing the code you have to download various dependency to run the code. The dependency are like CV2 , numpy , Face_recognition , os , datetime .After that you need to add the photos of the person in the folder named as "ImagesBasic". After that you can directly run the AttendanceProject.py file and after runing that file the camera of you system will automatically get ON and the photos of person you added that particular person should have his/her face infornt of the camera in a proper light surrounding and then it will detech the face of the person who image is store in "ImagesBasic" folder, and after the face of the person is detech ypu can now see the person's Attendance in the excel form(cvs file) which get create when your face get detect and also with the data and time libary you can see the live timing of the attendance when the face get detect
