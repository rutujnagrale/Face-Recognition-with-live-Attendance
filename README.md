The main purpose of this project is to build a face recognition-based attendance monitoring system for educational institution to enhance and upgrade the current attendance system into more efficient and effective as compared to before. The current old system has a lot of ambiguity that caused inaccurate and inefficient of attendance taking. Many problems arise when the authority is unable to enforce the regulations that exist in the old system. The technology working behind will be the face recognition system. The human face is one of the natural traits that can uniquely identify an individual. Therefore, it is used to trace identity as the possibilities for a face to deviate or being duplicated is low. In this project, face databases will be created to pump data into the recognizer algorithm. Then, during the attendance taking session, faces will be compared against the database to seek for identity. When an individual is identified, its attendance will be taken down automatically saving necessary information into a excel sheet. At the end of the day, the excel sheet containing attendance information regarding all individuals are mailed to the respective faculty


so have made this project on pycharm if you dont hava it you can also run this project smoothly on VScode. After importing the code you have to download various dependency to run the code. The dependency are like CV2 , numpy , Face_recognition , os , datetime .After that you need to add the photos of the person in the folder named as "ImagesBasic". After that you can directly run the AttendanceProject.py file and after runing that file the camera of you system will automatically get ON and the photos of person you added that particular person should have his/her face infornt of the camera in a proper light surrounding and then it will detech the face of the person who image is store in "ImagesBasic" folder, and after the face of the person is detech ypu can now see the person's Attendance in the excel form(cvs file) which get create when your face get detect and also with the data and time libary you can see the live timing of the attendance when the face get detect  

here is are some photos of the project
